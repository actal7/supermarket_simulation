# SuperMarket Simulation Homework Project

This is a simple simulation meant to determine the optimal number of employees required to serve a supermarket with certain parameters.

# notes

Using both window event listeners and [worker].onmessage event listeners to avoid pollution where possible

# challenges

large amounts of simulated days led to spawning too many web workers, had to do it in batches

# nice to have

disable start button if any input invalid / missing
multimodal distribution for clients
clean up those repetitions in UIController event handlers
